As the\\nbusiness expands, one needs more capital and\\nlarger number of people to manage the business and\\nshare its risks. In such a situation, people usually\\nadopt the partnership form of organisation.\\nAccounting for partnership firms has it’s own\\npeculiarities, as the partnership firm comes into\\nexistence when two or more persons come together\\nto establish business and share its profits. On many\\nissues affecting distribution of profits, there may not\\nbe any specific agreement between the partners. In\\nsuch a situation the provisions of the Indian\\nPartnership Act 1932 apply. Similarly, calculation\\nof interest on capital, interest on drawings and\\nmaintenance of partners capital accounts have their\\nown peculiarities. Not only that a variety of\\nadjustments are required on the death of a partner\\nor when a new partner is admitted and so on. These\\npeculiar situations need specific treatment in\\naccounting that need to be clarified.\\nThe present chapter discusses some basic\\naspects of  partnership such as distribution of profit,\\nmaintenance of capital accounts, etc. The treatment\\nof situations like admission of partner, retirement,\\ndeath and dissolution have been taken up in the\\nsubsequent chapters.\\n1.1 Nature of Partnership\\nWhen two or more persons join hands to set up a\\nbusiness and share its profits and losses, they are\\nsaid to be in partnership. Section 4 of the Indian\\nPartnership Act 1932 defines partnership as the\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this chapter,\\nyou will be able to :\\n•\\nDefine partnership and\\nlist its essential features;\\n•\\nIdentify the  provisions of\\nthe Indian Partnership\\nAct 1932 that are\\nrelevant for accounting;\\n•\\nPrepare partners’ capital\\naccounts under fixed and\\nfluctuating \\ncapital\\nmethods;\\n•\\nExplain the distribution\\nprofit or loss among the\\npartners and prepare the\\nProfit \\nand \\nLoss\\nAppropriation Account;\\n•\\nCalculate interest on\\ncapital and drawing\\nunder various situations;\\n•\\nExplain how guarantee\\nfor a minimum amount\\nof profit affects the\\ndistribution of profits\\namong the partners;\\n•\\nMake \\nnecessary\\nadjustments to rectify\\nthe past errors in\\npartners \\ncapital\\naccounts; and\\n•\\nPrepare final accounts of\\na partnership firm;\\nAccounting for Partnership: Basic Concepts\\n1\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n2\\nAccountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts\\n‘relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business\\ncarried on by all or any of them acting for all’.\\nPersons who have entered into partnership with one another are individually\\ncalled ‘partners’ and collectively called ‘firm’. The name under which the business\\nis carried is called the ‘firm’s name’. A partnership firm has no separate legal\\nentity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of\\npartnership are:\\n1. Two or More Persons: In order to form partnership, there should be at\\nleast two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words,\\nthe minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is however,\\na limit on their maximum number. By virtue of Section 464 of the\\nCompanies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe\\nmaximum number of partners in a firm but the number of partners can\\nnot be more than 100. The Central government has prescribed the\\nmaximum number of partness in a firm to be 50.\\n2. Agreement: Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or\\nmore persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The\\nagreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is\\nnot necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement\\nis equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the\\npartners have a written agreement.\\n3. Business: The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere co-\\nownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if\\nRohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint\\nowners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business\\nof purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will\\nbe called partners.\\n4. Mutual Agency: The business of a partnership concern may be carried\\non by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has\\ntwo important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate\\nin the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a\\nrelationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner\\ncarrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the\\nother partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound\\nby the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm.\\nRelationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that\\nthere would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent.\\n5. Sharing of Profit: Another important element of partnership is that, the\\nagreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a\\nbusiness. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes\\npartnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of\\na business, the sharing of loss is implied. Thus, sharing of profits and\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n3\\nAccounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts\\nlosses is important. If some persons join hands for the purpose of some\\ncharitable activity, it will not be termed as partnership.\\n6. Liability of Partners: Each partner is liable jointly with all the other\\npartners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm\\ndone while he is a partner. Not only that the liability of a partner for acts\\nof the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also\\nbe used for paying off the firm’s debts.\\n1.2 Partnership Deed\\nPartnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners.\\nThe agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require\\nthat the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document,\\nwhich contains terms of the agreement  is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It generally\\ncontains the details about all the aspects affecting the relationship between the\\npartners including the objective of business, contribution of capital by each\\npartner, ratio in which the profits and the losses will be shared by the partners\\nand entitlement of partners to interest on capital, interest on loan, etc.\\nThe clauses of partnership deed can be altered with the consent of all the\\npartners. The deed should be properly drafted and prepared as per the provisions\\nof the ‘Stamp Act’ and preferably registered with the Registrar of Firms.\\nContents of the Partnership Deed\\nThe Partnership Deed usually contains the following details:\\n•\\nNames and Addresses of the firm and its main business;\\n•\\nNames and Addresses of all partners;\\n•\\nAmount of capital to be contributed by each partner;\\n•\\nThe accounting period of the firm;\\n•\\nThe date of commencement of partnership;\\n•\\nRules regarding operation of Bank Accounts;\\n•\\nProfit and loss sharing ratio;\\n•\\nRate of interest on capital, loan, drawings, etc;\\n•\\nMode of auditor’s appointment, if any;\\n•\\nSalaries, commission, etc, if payable to any partner;\\n•\\nThe rights, duties and liabilities of each partner;\\n•\\nTreatment of loss arising out of insolvency of one or more partners;\\n•\\nSettlement of accounts on dissolution of the firm;\\n•\\nMethod of settlement of disputes among the partners;\\n•\\nRules to be followed in case of admission, retirement, death of a partner; and\\n•\\nAny other matter relating to the conduct of business.\\nNormally, the partnership deed covers all matters affecting relationship of\\npartners amongst themselves. However, if there is no express agreement on\\ncertain matters, the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 shall apply.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n4\\nAccountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts\\n1.2.1 Provisions of Partnership Act Relevant for Accounting\\nThe important provisions affecting partnership accounts are as follows:\\n(a) Profit Sharing Ratio: If the partnership deed is silent about the profit\\nsharing ratio, the profits and losses of the firm are to be shared equally\\nby partners, irrespective of their capital contribution in the firm.\\n(b) Interest on Capital: No partner is entitled to claim any interest on the\\namount of capital contributed by him in the firm as a matter of right.\\nHowever, interest can be allowed when it is expressly agreed to by the\\npartners. Thus, no interest on capital is payable if the partnership deed\\nis silent on the issue.\\n(c) Interest on Drawings: No interest is to be charged on the drawings made\\nby the partners, if there is no mention in the Deed.\\n(d) Interest on Loan: If any partner has advanced loan to the firm for the\\npurpose of business, he/she shall be entitled to get an interest on the\\nloan amount at the rate of 6 per  cent per annum.\\n(e) Remuneration for Firm’s Work: No partner is entitled to get salary or\\nother remuneration for taking part in the conduct of the business of the\\nfirm unless there is a provision for the same in the Partnership Deed.\\nApart from the above, the Indian Partnership Act specifies that subject to\\ncontract between the partners:\\n(i) If a partner derives any profit for him/her self from any transaction of the\\nfirm or from the use of the property or business connection of the firm or\\nthe firm name, he/she shall account for the profit and pay it to the firm.\\n(ii) If a partner carries on any business of the same nature as and competing\\nwith that of the firm, he/she shall account for and pay to the firm, all\\nprofit made by him/her in that business.\\nTest your Understanding – I\\n1. Mohan and Shyam are partners in a firm. State whether the claim is valid if the\\npartnership agreement is silent in the following matters:\\n(i) Mohan is an active partner. He wants a salary of Rs. 10,000 per year;\\n(ii) Shyam had advanced a loan to the firm. He claims interest @ 10% per\\nannum;\\n(iii) Mohan has contributed Rs. 20,000 and Shyam Rs. 50,000 as capital. Mohan\\nwants equal share in profits.\\n(iv) Shyam wants interest on capital to be credited @ 6% per annum.\\n2. State whether the following statements are true or false:\\n(i) Valid partnership can be formulated even without a written agreement\\nbetween the partners;\\n(ii) Each partner carrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent\\nfor all the other partners;\\n(iii) Maximum number of partners can be 50;\\n(iv) Methods of settlement of dispute among the partners can’t be part of the\\npartnership deed;\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n5\\nAccounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts\\n(v) If the deed is silent, interest at the rate of 6% p.a. would be charged on the\\ndrawings made by the partner;\\n(vi) Interest on partner’s loan is to be given @ 12% p.a., if the deed is silent\\nabout the rate.\\n1.3 Special Aspects of Partnership Accounts\\nAccounting treatment for partnership firm is similar to that of a sole\\nproprietorship business with the exception of the following aspects:\\n•\\nMaintenance of Partners’ Capital Accounts;\\n•\\nDistribution of Profit and Loss among the partners;\\n•\\nAdjustments for Wrong Appropriation of Profits in the Past;\\n•\\nReconstitution of the Partnership Firm; and\\n•\\nDissolution of Partnership Firm.\\nThe first three aspects mentioned above have been taken up in the following\\nsections of this chapter. The remaining aspects have been covered in the\\nsubsequent chapters.\\n1.4 Maintenance of Capital Accounts of Partners\\nAll transactions relating to partners of the firm are recorded in the books of the\\nfirm through their capital accounts. This includes the amount of money brought\\nin as capital, withdrawal of capital, share of profit, interest on capital, interest\\non drawings, partner’s salary, commission to partners, etc.\\nThere are two methods by which the capital accounts of partners can be\\nmaintained. These are: (i) fixed capital method, and (ii) fluctuating capital\\nmethod. The difference between the two lies in whether or not the transactions\\nother than addition/withdrawal of capital are recorded in the capital accounts\\nof the partners.\\n(a) Fixed Capital Method: Under the fixed capital method, the capitals of the\\npartners shall remain fixed unless additional capital is introduced or a\\npart of the capital is withdrawn as per the agreement among the partners.\\nAll items like share of profit or loss, interest on capital, drawings, interest\\non drawings, etc. are recorded in a separate accounts, called Partner’s\\nCurrent Account. The partners’ capital accounts will always show a credit\\nbalance, which shall remain the same (fixed) year after year unless there\\nis any addition or withdrawal of capital. The partners’ current account\\non the other hand, may show a debit or a credit balance. Thus under\\nthis method, two accounts are maintained for each partner viz., capital\\naccount and current account, While the partners’ capital accounts shall\\nalways appear on the liabilities side in the balance sheet, the partners’\\ncurrent account’s balance shall be shown on the liabilities side, if they\\nhave credit balance and on the assets side, if they have debit balance.\\nThe partner’s capital account and the current account under the fixed capital\\nmethod would appear as shown in Fig.1.1.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n6\\nAccountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts\\nPartner’s Capital Account\\nDr.\\nCr.\\nDate\\nParticulars\\nJ.F.

All the\\nadjustments such as share of profit and loss, interest on capital, drawings,\\ninterest on drawings, salary or commission to partners, etc are recorded\\ndirectly in the capital accounts of the partners. This makes the balance\\nin the capital account to fluctuate from time to time. That’s the reason\\nwhy this method is called fluctuating capital method. In the absence of\\nany instruction, the capital account should be prepared by this method.\\nThe proforma of capital accounts prepared under the fluctuating capital method\\nis given in Fig.1.2.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n7\\nAccounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts\\nPartner’s Capital Account\\nDr.\\nCr.\\nDate     Particulars\\nJ.F.

However, if the partnership deed is silent, the firm’s profits and losses are\\nto be shared equally by all the partners.\\nYou know that in the case of sole partnership the profit or loss, as ascertained\\nby the profit and loss account is transferred to the capital account of the\\nproprietor. In case of partnership, however, certain adjustments such as interest\\non drawings, interest on capital, salary to partners, and commission to partners\\nare required to be made. For this purpose, it is customary to prepare a Profit\\nand Loss Appropriation Account of the firm and ascertain the final figure of\\nprofit and loss to be distributed among the partners, in their profit\\nsharing ratio.\\n1.5.1 Profit and Loss Appropriation Account\\nProfit and Loss Appropriation Account is merely an extension of the Profit and\\nLoss Account of the firm. It shows how the profits are appropriated or distributed\\namong the partners. All adjustments in respect of partner’s salary, partner’s\\ncommission, interest on capital, interest on drawings, etc. are made through\\nthis account. It starts with the net profit/net loss as per Profit and Loss Account.\\nThe journal entries for preparation of Profit and Loss Appropriation Account\\nand making various adjustments through it are given as follows:\\nJournal Entries\\n1.

When the Deed specifically provides for it, interest on capital is\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n16\\nAccountancy – Not-for-Profit Organisation and Partnership Accounts\\ncredited to the partners at the agreed rate with reference to the time period for\\nwhich the capital remained in business during a financial year. Interest on capital\\nis generally provided for in two situations: (i) when the partners contribute\\nunequal amounts of capitals but share profits equally, and (ii) where the capital\\ncontribution is same but profit sharing is unequal.\\nInterest on capital is calculated with due allowance for any addition or\\nwithdrawal of capital during the accounting period. For example, Mohini, Rashmi\\nand Navin entered into partnership, bringing in Rs. 3,00,000, Rs. 2,00,000 and\\nRs. 1,00,000 respectively into the business. They decided to share profits and\\nlosses equally and agreed that interest on capital will be provided to the partners\\n@10 per cent per annum. There was no addition or withdrawal of capital by any\\npartner during the year. The interest on capital works out to Rs. 30,000\\n(10% on 30,000) for  Mohini, Rs. 20,000 (10% on 2,00,000) for Rashmi, and Rs.\\n10,000 (10% on 1,00,000) for Navin.\\nTake another case of Mansoor and Reshma who are partners in a firm and\\ntheir capital accounts showed the balance of Rs. 2,00,000 and Rs. 1,50,000\\nrespectively on April 1, 2019.

Such assurance\\nmay be given by all the old partners  in a certain ratio or by any of the old\\npartners, individually to the new partner. The minimum guaranteed amount\\nshall be paid to such new partner when his share of profit as per the profit\\nsharing ratio is less than the guarnteed amount. For example, Madhulika and\\nRakshita, who are partners in a firm decide to admit Kanishka into their firm,\\ngiving her the guarantee of a minimum of Rs.25,000 as her share in firm’s profits.\\nThe firm earned a profit of Rs.1,20,000 during the year and the agreed profit\\nsharing ratio between the partners is decided as 2:3:1. As per this ratio,\\nMadhulika’s share in profit comes to Rs.40,000 (2/6 of Rs. 1,20,000); Rakshita,\\nRs. 60,000 (3/6 of Rs. 1,20,000) and Kanishka Rs. 20,000 (1/6 of Rs. 1,20,000).\\nThe share of Kanishka works out to be Rs.5,000 short of the guaranteed amount.\\nThis shall be borne by the guaranteeing partners Madhulika and Rakshita in\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n\\n27\\nAccounting for Partnership : Basic Concepts\\ntheir profit sharing ratio, which in this case is 2:3, Madhulika’s share in the\\ndeficiency comes to Rs.2,000 (2/5 of Rs. 5,000), and that of Rakshita Rs.3,000.\\nThe total profit of the firm will be distributed among the partners as follows\\nMadhulika will get Rs.38,000 (her share 40,000 minus share in deficiency\\nRs.2,000); Rakshita Rs.57,000 (60,000–3,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000\\n(Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 2,000 + Rs. 3,000).\\nIf only one partner gives the guarantee, say in the above case, only Rakshita\\ngives the guarantee, the whole amount of deficiency (Rs.5,000) will be borne by\\nher only. In that case profit distribution will be Madhulika Rs.40,000, Rakshita\\nRs. 55,000 (60,000–5,000) and Kanishka Rs. 25,000 (Rs. 20,000 + Rs. 5,000).\\nIllustration 10\\nMohit and Rohan share profits and losses in the ratio of 2:1.

The omission may be\\nin respect of interest on capitals, interest on drawings, interest on partners’ loan,\\npartner’s salary, partner’s commission or outstanding expenses. There may also\\nbe some changes in the provisions of partnership deed or system of accounting\\nhaving impact with retrospective effect. All these acts of omission and commission\\nneed adjustments for correction of their impact. Instead of altering old accounts,\\nnecessary adjustments can be made either; (a) through ‘Profit and Loss\\nAdjustment Account’, or (b) directly in the capital accounts of the concerned\\npartners. This is explained with the help of following example.\\nRameez and Zaheer are equal partners. Their capitals as on April 01, 2015\\nwere Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1,00,000 respectively. After the accounts for the financial\\nyear ending March 31, 2016 have been prepared, it is discovered that interest at\\nthe rate of 6 per cent per annum, as provided in the partnership deed has not\\nbeen credited to the partners’ capital accounts before distribution of profit. In\\nthis case, the interest on capital not credited to the partners’ capital accounts\\nworks out to be Rs. 3000 (6/100 × Rs. 50,000) for Rameez and Rs. 6,000\\n(6/100 × Rs. 1,00,000) for Zaheer. Had the interest on capital been duly provided,\\nthe firm’s profit would have reduced by Rs. 9,000. By this omission, the whole\\namount of  profit as per Profit and Loss Account (without adjustment of Rs.\\n9,000) has been distributed among the partners in their profit sharing ratio,\\nand the amounts of interest on capital have not been credited to their capital\\naccounts.

The essential features of\\npartnership are : (i) To form a partnership, there must be at least two persons;\\n(ii) It is created by an agreement; (iii) The agreement should be for carrying on\\nsome legal business; (iv) sharing of profits and losses; and (v) relationship of\\nmutual agency among the partners.\\n2.\\nMeaning and contents of partnership deed: A document which contains the terms\\nof partnership as agreed among the partners is called ‘Partnership Deed’. It\\nusually contains information about all aspects affecting relationship between\\npartners, including objective of business, contribution of capital by each partner,\\nratio in which profit and losses will be shared by the partners, entitlement of\\npartners to interest on capital, interest on loan and the rules to be followed in\\ncase of admission, retirement, death, dissolution, etc.\\n3.\\nProvisions of Partnership Act 1932 applicable to accounting: If partnership deed\\nis silent in respect of certain aspects, the relevant provisions of the Indian\\nPartnership Act, 1932 become applicable. According to the Partnership Act,\\nthe partners share profits equally, no partner is entitled to remuneration, no\\ninterest on capital is allowed and no interest on drawings is charged. However,\\nif any partner has given some loan to the firm, he is entitled to interest on such\\namount @ 6% per annum.\\n4.\\nPreparation of capital accounts under fixed and fluctuating capital methods: All\\ntransactions relating to partners are recorded in their respective capital\\naccounts in the books of the firm. There can be two methods of maintaining\\nCapital Accounts. These are; (i) fluctuating capital method, (ii) fixed capital\\nmethod. Under fluctuating capital method, all the transactions relating to a\\npartner are directly recorded in the capital account. Under fixed capital method,\\nhowever the amount of capital remains fixed, the transactions like interest on\\ncapital, drawings, interest on drawings, salary, commission, share of profit or\\nloss are recorded in a separate account called ‘Partner’s Current Account’.\\n5.\\nDistribution of profit and loss: The distribution of profits among the partners is\\nshown through a Profit and Loss Appropriation Account, which is merely an\\nextension of the Profit and Loss Account.

If, in any\\nyear, the share of profits as calculated according to his profit sharing ratio is\\nless than the guaranteed amount, the deficiency is made good by the\\nguaranteeing partners’ in the agreed ratio which usually is the profit sharing\\nratio. If, however, such guarantee has been given by any of them, he or they\\nalone shall bear the amount of deficiency.\\n7.\\nTreatment of past adjustments: If, after the final accounts have been prepared,\\nsome omission or commissions are noticed say in respect of the interest on\\ncapital, interest on drawings, partner’s salary, commission, etc. necessary\\nadjustments can be made in the partner’s capital accounts through the Profit\\nand Loss Adjustment Account, to rectify the same.\\n8.\\nPreparation of final accounts of a partnership firm: There is not much difference\\nin the final accounts of a sole proprietary concern and that of a partnership\\nfirm except that in case of a partnership firm an additional account called\\nProfit and Loss Appropriation Account is prepared to show distribution of profit\\nand loss among the partners.\\nQuestions for Practice\\nShort Answer Questions\\n1.\\nDefine Partnership Deed.\\n2.\\nWhy is it considered desirable to make the  partnership agreement in writing?\\n3.\\nList the items which may be debited or credited in capital accounts of the\\npartners when:\\n(i)\\nCapitals are fixed.\\n(ii)\\nCapital are fluctuating.\\n4.\\nWhy is Profit and Loss Appropriation Account prepared?\\n5.\\nGive two circumstances under which the fixed capitals of partners may change.\\n6.\\nIf a fixed amount is withdrawn on the first day of every quarter, for what period\\nthe interest on total amount withdrawn will be calculated?\\n7.\\nIn the absence of Partnership deed, specify the rules relating to the following :\\n(i)\\nSharing of profits and losses.\\n(ii)\\nInterest on partner’s capital.\\n(iii)\\nInterest on Partner’s drawings.\\n(iv)\\nInterest on Partner’s loan\\n(v)\\nSalary to a partner.\\nLong Answer Questions\\n1.\\nWhat is meant by partnership?

The name under which the business\\nis carried is called the ‘firm’s name’. A partnership firm has no separate legal\\nentity, apart from the partners constituting it. Thus, the essential features of\\npartnership are:\\n1. Two or More Persons: In order to form partnership, there should be at\\nleast two persons coming together for a common goal. In other words,\\nthe minimum number of partners in a firm can be two. There is however,\\na limit on their maximum number. By virtue of Section 464 of the\\nCompanies Act 2013, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe\\nmaximum number of partners in a firm but the number of partners can', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/RAG/datasets/TXTs/Accounts101.txt'}), Document(page_content='not be more than 100. The Central government has prescribed the\\nmaximum number of partness in a firm to be 50.\\n2. Agreement: Partnership is the result of an agreement between two or\\nmore persons to do business and share its profits and losses. The\\nagreement becomes the basis of relationship between the partners. It is\\nnot necessary that such agreement is in written form. An oral agreement\\nis equally valid. But in order to avoid disputes, it is preferred that the\\npartners have a written agreement.\\n3. Business: The agreement should be to carry on some business. Mere co-\\nownership of a property does not amount to partnership. For example, if\\nRohit and Sachin jointly purchase a plot of land, they become the joint\\nowners of the property and not the partners. But if they are in the business\\nof purchase and sale of land for the purpose of making profit, they will\\nbe called partners.\\n4. Mutual Agency: The business of a partnership concern may be carried', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/RAG/datasets/TXTs/Accounts101.txt'}), Document(page_content='on by all the partners or any of them acting for all. This statement has\\ntwo important implications. First, every partner is entitled to participate\\nin the conduct of the affairs of its business. Second, that there exists a\\nrelationship of mutual agency between all the partners. Each partner\\ncarrying on the business is the principal as well as the agent for all the\\nother partners. He can bind other partners by his acts and also is bound\\nby the acts of other partners with regard to business of the firm.\\nRelationship of mutual agency is so important that one can say that\\nthere would be no partnership, if the element of mutual agency is absent.\\n5. Sharing of Profit: Another important element of partnership is that, the\\nagreement between partners must be to share profits and losses of a\\nbusiness. Though the definition contained in the Partnership Act describes\\npartnership as relation between people who agree to share the profits of', metadata={'source': '/home/ubuntu/RAG/datasets/TXTs/Accounts101.txt'}), Document(page_content='a business, the sharing of loss is implied.

Liability of Partners: Each partner is liable jointly with all the other\\npartners and also severally to the third party for all the acts of the firm\\ndone while he is a partner. Not only that the liability of a partner for acts\\nof the firm is also unlimited. This implies that his private assets can also\\nbe used for paying off the firm’s debts.\\n1.2 Partnership Deed\\nPartnership comes into existence as a result of agreement among the partners.\\nThe agreement can be either oral or written. The Partnership Act does not require\\nthat the agreement must be in writing. But wherever it is in writing, the document,\\nwhich contains terms of the agreement  is called ‘Partnership Deed’.
