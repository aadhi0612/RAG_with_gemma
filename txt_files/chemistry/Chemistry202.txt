You have learnt that substitution of one or more
hydrogen atom(s) from a hydrocarbon by another atom
or a group of atoms result in the formation of an entirely
new compound having altogether different properties
and applications. Alcohols and phenols are formed
when a hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon, aliphatic and
aromatic respectively, is replaced by –OH group. These
classes of compounds find wide applications in industry
as well as in day-to-day life. For instance, have you
ever noticed that ordinary spirit used for polishing
wooden furniture is chiefly a compound containing
hydroxyl group, ethanol. The sugar we eat, the cotton
used for fabrics, the paper we use for writing, are all
made up of compounds containing –OH groups. Just
think of life without paper; no note-books, books, news-
papers, currency notes, cheques, certificates, etc. The
magazines carrying beautiful photographs and
interesting stories would disappear from our life. It
would have been really a different world.
An alcohol contains one or more hydroxyl (OH)
group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s), of an
aliphatic system (CH3OH) while a phenol contains –OH
group(s) directly attached to carbon atom(s) of an
aromatic system (C6H5OH).
The substitution of a hydrogen atom in a
hydrocarbon by an alkoxy or aryloxy group
(R–O/Ar–O) yields another class of compounds known
as ‘ethers’, for example, CH3OCH3 (dimethyl ether). You

substituting the hydrogen atom of hydroxyl group of an alcohol or
phenol by an alkyl or aryl group.
In this unit, we shall discuss the chemistry of three classes of
compounds, namely — alcohols, phenols and ethers.
Monohydric alcohols may be further classified according to the
hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is
attached.

Primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of
alcohols, the –OH group is attached to primary, secondary and
tertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below:
Allylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to
a sp
3 hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double
bond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example
Benzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached
to a sp
3—hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For
example.
The classification of compounds makes their study systematic and
hence simpler. Therefore, let us first learn how are alcohols, phenols
and ethers classified?
Alcohols and phenols may be classified as mono–, di–, tri- or
polyhydric compounds depending on whether they contain one, two,
three or many hydroxyl groups respectively in their structures as

Chemistry
According to IUPAC system, the name of an alcohol is derived from the
name of the alkane from which the alcohol is derived, by substituting ‘e’
of alkane with the suffix ‘ol’. The position of substituents are indicated
by numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is
numbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group. The positions
of the –OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the
numbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming
polyhydric alcohols, the ‘e’ of alkane is retained and the ending ‘ol’ is
added. The number of –OH groups is indicated by adding the
multiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before ‘ol’. The positions of –OH groups
are indicated by appropriate locants, e.g., HO–CH2–CH2–OH is named as
ethane–1, 2-diol. Table 7.1 gives common and IUPAC names of a few
alcohols as examples.

If both the alkyl groups are the same, the prefix ‘di’ is added before the alkyl
group. For example, C2H5OC2H5 is diethyl ether.
According to IUPAC system of nomenclature, ethers are regarded as
hydrocarbon derivatives in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an
–OR or –OAr group, where R and Ar represent alkyl and aryl groups,
respectively. The larger (R) group is chosen as the parent hydrocarbon.

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers
The bond angle 
 in alcohols is slightly less than the tetrahedral
angle (109°-28¢). It is due to the repulsion between the unshared
electron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the –OH group is attached to sp
2
hybridised carbon of an aromatic ring.  The carbon– oxygen bond
length (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This
is due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation
of unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring
(Section 7.4.4) and (ii) sp
2 hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen
is attached.
In ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e., the two bond pairs and two
lone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a
tetrahedral arrangement. The bond  angle is slightly greater than the
tetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two
bulky (–R) groups. The C–O bond length (141 pm) is almost the same
as in alcohols.
7.4.1
Preparation of Alcohols
Alcohols are prepared by the following methods:
1. From alkenes
(i) By acid catalysed hydration: Alkenes react with water in the
presence of acid as catalyst to form alcohols. In case of
unsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in
accordance with Markovnikov’s rule.
Mechanism

Step 1: Protonation of alkene to form carbocation by electrophilic
attack of H3O

Chemistry
(ii) By hydroboration–oxidation: Diborane (BH3)2 reacts with alkenes
to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to
alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium
hydroxide.
The addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such
a manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp
2 carbon
carrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed
looks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the
alkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov’s rule. In this reaction,
alcohol is obtained in excellent yield.
2. From carbonyl compounds
(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones
are reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of
hydrogen in the presence of catalysts (catalytic hydrogenation).
The usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum,
palladium or nickel. It is also prepared by treating aldehydes
and ketones with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or lithium
aluminium hydride (LiAlH4). Aldehydes yield primary alcohols
whereas ketones give secondary alcohols.
(ii) By reduction of carboxylic acids and esters: Carboxylic acids
are reduced to primary alcohols in excellent yields by lithium
aluminium hydride, a strong reducing agent.

However, LiAlH4 is an expensive reagent, and therefore,  used
for preparing special chemicals only. Commercially, acids are
reduced to alcohols by converting them to the esters (Section

presence of  catalyst (catalytic hydrogenation).

Benzene is sulphonated with oleum and benzene sulphonic acid so
formed is converted to sodium phenoxide on heating with molten
sodium hydroxide. Acidification of the sodium salt gives phenol.
3. From diazonium salts
A diazonium salt is formed by treating an aromatic primary amine
with nitrous acid (NaNO2 + HCl) at 273-278 K. Diazonium salts are
hydrolysed to phenols by warming with  water or by treating with
dilute acids (Unit 9, Class XII).

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers
Alcohols and phenols consist of two parts, an alkyl/aryl group and a
hydroxyl group. The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due
to the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply
modify these properties.
Boiling Points
The boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the
number of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,
the boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain
(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface
area).
The –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding as shown below:
It is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols
are higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely
hydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable
molecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable
molecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling
point of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.

The high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence
of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers
and hydrocarbons.
Solubility
Solubility of alcohols and phenols in
water is due to their ability to form
hydrogen bonds with water molecules

increase in size of alkyl/aryl (hydro-

The above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are
acidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted
acids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:).
(ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to
the polar nature of O–H bond. An electron-releasing group
(–CH3, –C2H5) increases electron density on oxygen tending to
decrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid
strength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases
in the following order:
Rationalised 2023-24

206
Chemistry
Alcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be
illustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide.
This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,
stronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note
that an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide
ion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium
ethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide).
Alcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the
presence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes
them proton acceptors.
(iii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,
sodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic
nature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to
the sp
2 hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an
electron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution
in phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures,
causes the oxygen of –OH group to be positive.
The reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide
indicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water.
Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group
attached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in
which hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group.
The ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:
Due to the higher electronegativity of sp
2 hybridised carbon
of phenol to which –OH is attached, electron density decreases
on oxygen. This increases the polarity of O–H bond and results
in an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols.
Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide
ions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen
while in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised.
The delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes
Rationalised 2023-24

phenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol.
Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its
resonance structures have charge separation due to which the
phenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion.

2. Esterification
Alcohols and phenols react with carboxylic acids, acid chlorides and
acid anhydrides to form esters.
In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing
groups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of
phenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is
present at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective
delocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when
substituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand,
electron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do
not favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease
in acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol.

The reaction with carboxylic acid and acid anhydride is carried

the presence of a base (pyridine) so as to neutralise HCl which is
formed during the reaction. It  shifts the equilibrium to the right

is produced immediately as they form the halides easily. Primary
alcohols do not produce turbidity at room temperature.
2. Reaction with phosphorus trihalides: Alcohols are converted to
alkyl bromides by reaction with phosphorus tribromide (Refer
Unit 6, Class XII).
3. Dehydration: Alcohols undergo dehydration (removal of a molecule
of water) to form alkenes  on treating with a protic acid e.g.,
concentrated H2SO4 or H3PO4, or catalysts such as anhydrous zinc
chloride or alumina.
Ethanol undergoes dehydration by heating it with concentrated

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers
Secondary and tertiary alcohols are dehydrated under milder
conditions. For example
Thus, the relative ease of dehydration of alcohols follows the
following order:
Tertiary
Secondary
Primary
>
>
The mechanism of dehydration of ethanol involves the following steps:
Mechanism
Step 1: Formation of protonated alcohol.
Step 2: Formation of carbocation: It is the slowest step and hence, the
rate determining step of the reaction.
Step 3: Formation of ethene by elimination of a proton.
The acid used in step 1 is released in step 3. To drive the equilibrium
to the right, ethene is removed as it is formed.
4. Oxidation: Oxidation of alcohols involves the formation of a carbon-
oxygen double bond with cleavage of an O-H and C-H bonds.
Such a cleavage and formation of bonds occur in oxidation
reactions. These are also known as dehydrogenation reactions as
these involve loss of dihydrogen from an alcohol molecule.  Depending
on the oxidising agent used, a primary alcohol is oxidised to an
aldehyde which in turn is oxidised to a carboxylic acid.
Tertiary carbocations
are more stable and
therefore are easier to
form than secondary
and primary
carbocations; tertiary
alcohols are the easiest
to dehydrate.

Secondary alcohols are oxidised to ketones by chromic anhyride
(CrO3).
Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation reaction. Under strong
reaction conditions such as strong oxidising agents (KMnO4) and
elevated temperatures, cleavage of various C-C bonds takes place
and a mixture of carboxylic
acids containing lesser number
of carbon atoms is formed.
When the vapours of a
primary or a secondary alcohol
are passed over heated copper
at 573 K, dehydrogenation
takes place and an aldehyde or
a ketone is formed while tertiary
alcohols undergo dehydration.
Biological oxidation of methanol and ethanol in the body produces the corresponding
aldehyde followed by the acid. At times the alcoholics, by mistake, drink ethanol,
mixed with methanol also called denatured alcohol. In the body, methanol is oxidised
first to methanal and then to methanoic acid, which may cause blindness and
death. A methanol poisoned patient is treated by giving intravenous infusions of
diluted ethanol. The enzyme responsible for oxidation of aldehyde (HCHO) to acid
is swamped allowing time for kidneys to excrete methanol.

1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution
In phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are
electrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 9, Class XI). The –OH group
attached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic
substitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to
the resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures
are shown under acidity of phenols.
Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place
in phenol are as follows:
(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K),
phenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols.
The ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam
distillation. o-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular
hydrogen bonding while p-nitrophenol is less volatile due to
intermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association
of molecules.
With concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to
2,4,6-trinitrophenol. The product is commonly known as picric
acid. The yield of the reaction product is poor.
Nowadays picric acid is prepared by treating phenol first
with concentrated sulphuric acid which converts it to
phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, and then with concentrated nitric
acid to get 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. Can you write the equations of
the reactions involved?

The usual halogenation of benzene takes place in the
presence of a Lewis acid, such as FeBr3 (Unit 6, Class XII),
which polarises the halogen molecule.  In case of phenol, the
polarisation of bromine molecule takes place even in the
absence of Lewis acid.  It is due to the highly activating
effect of –OH group attached to the benzene ring.

2,4,6-tribromophenol is formed as white precipitate.

Chemistry
Methanol and ethanol are among the two commercially important
alcohols.
1. Methanol
Methanol, CH3OH, also known as ‘wood spirit’, was produced by
destructive distillation of wood. Today, most of the methanol is
produced by catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide at high
pressure and temperature and in the presence of ZnO – Cr2O3
catalyst.
Methanol is a colourless liquid and boils at 337 K.  It is highly
poisonous in nature.  Ingestion of even small quantities of methanol
can cause blindness and large quantities causes even death. Methanol
is used as a solvent in paints, varnishes and chiefly for making
formaldehyde.
2. Ethanol
Ethanol, C2H5OH, is obtained commercially by fermentation, the
oldest method is from sugars.  The sugar in molasses, sugarcane
or fruits such as grapes is converted to glucose and fructose, (both
of which have the formula C6H12O6), in the presence of an enzyme,
invertase. Glucose and fructose undergo fermentation in the
presence of another enzyme, zymase, which is found in yeast.
In wine making, grapes are the source of sugars and yeast. As
grapes ripen, the quantity of sugar increases and yeast grows on the
outer skin. When grapes are crushed, sugar and the enzyme come in
contact and fermentation starts. Fermentation takes place in
anaerobic conditions i.e. in absence of air. Carbon dioxide is released
during fermentation.
The action of zymase is inhibited once the percentage of alcohol
formed exceeds 14 percent. If air gets into fermentation mixture, the
oxygen of air oxidises ethanol to ethanoic acid which in turn destroys
the taste of alcoholic drinks.
Ethanol is a colourless liquid with boiling point 351 K. It is used
as a solvent in paint industry and in the preparation of a number of
carbon compounds. The commercial alcohol is made unfit for drinking
by mixing in it some copper sulphate (to give it a colour) and pyridine
(a foul smelling liquid). It is known as denaturation of alcohol.
Nowadays, large quantities of ethanol are obtained by hydration of
ethene (Section 7.4).

Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers
1. By dehydration of alcohols
Alcohols undergo dehydration in the presence of protic acids
(H2SO4, H3PO4). The formation of  the reaction product, alkene or ether
depends on the reaction conditions. For example, ethanol is
dehydrated to ethene in the presence of sulphuric acid at 443 K.
At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product.
The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (SN2)
involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as
indicated below:

7.6.1
Preparation
of Ethers
Acidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated
with substitution reaction to give an ether.
The method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having
primary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered
and the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the
formation of alkene. The reaction follows SN1 pathway when the alcohol
is secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes.
However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give
corresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over
substitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed.
Can you explain why is bimolecular dehydration not appropriate
for the preparation of ethyl methyl ether?
2. Williamson synthesis

symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers.  In this method, an alkyl
halide is allowed to react with sodium alkoxide.

But due to its slow
effect and an

Better results are obtained if the alkyl halide is primary. In case
of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides, elimination competes over
substitution. If a tertiary alkyl halide is used, an alkene is the only
reaction product and no ether is formed. For example, the reaction of
CH3ONa with (CH3)3C–Br gives exclusively 2-methylpropene.
It is because alkoxides are not only nucleophiles but strong bases
as well. They react with alkyl halides leading to elimination reactions.
The following is not an appropriate reaction for the preparation of
t-butyl ethyl ether.
(i) What would be the major product of this reaction ?
(ii) Write a suitable reaction for the preparation of t-butylethyl ether.
(i) The major product of the given reaction is 2-methylprop-1-ene.
It is because sodium ethoxide is a strong nucleophile as well as

substitution.

The C-O bonds in ethers are polar and thus, ethers have a net dipole
moment. The weak polarity of ethers do not appreciably affect their
boiling points which are comparable to those of the alkanes of
comparable molecular masses but are much lower than the boiling
points of alcohols as shown in the following cases:

The large difference in boiling points of alcohols and ethers is due
to the presence of hydrogen bonding in alcohols.
The miscibility of ethers with water resembles those of alcohols of
the same molecular mass. Both ethoxyethane and butan-1-ol are
miscible to almost the same extent i.e., 7.5 and 9 g per 100 mL water,
respectively while pentane is essentially immiscible with water. Can
you explain this observation ? This is due to the fact that just like
alcohols, oxygen of ether can also form hydrogen bonds with water
molecule as shown:
1. Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers
Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of
C-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess
of hydrogen halides.  The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl
halide molecules.
Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the
more stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl
halide.
Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same
manner.
The order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows:
HI > HBr > HCl. The cleavage of ethers takes place with concentrated
HI or HBr at high temperature.

Chemistry
The reaction of an ether with concentrated HI starts with protonation of ether molecule.
Step 1:
The reaction takes place with HBr or HI because these reagents are sufficiently acidic.
Step 2:
Iodide is a good nucleophile. It attacks the least substituted carbon of the oxonium
ion formed in step 1 and displaces an alcohol molecule by SN2
 mechanism.
Thus, in the cleavage of mixed ethers with two different alkyl groups, the alcohol
and alkyl iodide formed, depend on the nature of alkyl groups. When primary or
secondary alkyl groups are present, it is the lower alkyl group that forms alkyl
iodide (SN2 reaction).
When HI is in excess and the reaction is carried out at high temperature,
ethanol reacts with another molecule of HI and is converted to ethyl iodide.

acid group in aryl sulphonic acids, by –OH group (2) by hydrolysis of diazonium
salts and (3) industrially from cumene.
Alcohols are higher boiling than other classes of compounds, namely
hydrocarbons, ethers and haloalkanes of comparable molecular masses.  The
ability of alcohols, phenols and ethers to form intermolecular hydrogen bonding
with water makes them soluble in it.
Alcohols and phenols are acidic in nature. Electron withdrawing groups in
phenol increase its acidic strength and electron releasing groups decrease it.
Alcohols undergo nucleophilic substitution with hydrogen halides to yield
alkyl halides. Dehydration of alcohols gives alkenes. On oxidation, primary alcohols
yield aldehydes with mild oxidising agents and carboxylic acids with strong
oxidising agents while secondary alcohols yield ketones. Tertiary alcohols are
resistant to oxidation.
The presence of –OH group in phenols activates the aromatic ring towards
electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming group to ortho and para
positions due to resonance effect. Reimer-Tiemann reaction of phenol yields
salicylaldehyde. In presence of sodium hydroxide, phenol generates phenoxide
ion which is even more reactive than phenol. Thus, in alkaline medium, phenol
undergoes Kolbe’s reaction.
Ethers may be prepared by (i) dehydration of alcohols and (ii) Williamson
synthesis. The boiling points of ethers resemble those of alkanes while their
solubility is comparable to those of alcohols having same molecular mass. The
