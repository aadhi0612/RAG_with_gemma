The replacement of hydrogen atom(s) in an aliphatic
or aromatic hydrocarbon by halogen atom(s) results
in the formation of alkyl halide (haloalkane) and aryl
halide (haloarene), respectively. Haloalkanes contain
halogen atom(s) attached to the sp3 hybridised carbon
atom of an alkyl group whereas haloarenes contain
halogen atom(s) attached to sp2 hybridised carbon
atom(s) of an aryl group. Many halogen containing
organic compounds occur in nature and some of
these are clinically useful. These classes of compounds
find wide applications in industry as well as in day-
to-day life. They are used as solvents for relatively
non-polar compounds and as starting materials for
the synthesis of wide range of organic compounds.
Chlorine containing antibiotic, chloramphenicol,
produced by microorganisms is very effective for the
treatment of typhoid fever. Our body produces iodine
containing hormone, thyroxine, the deficiency of which
causes a disease called goiter. Synthetic halogen
compounds, viz. chloroquine is used for the treatment
of malaria; halothane is used as an anaesthetic
during surgery. Certain fully fluorinated compounds
are being considered as potential blood substitutes
in surgery.

Chemistry
Haloalkanes and haloarenes may be classified as follows:
These may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-,tetra-, etc.)
compounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen
atoms in their structures. For example,
Monohalocompounds may further be classified according to the
hybridisation of the carbon atom to which the halogen is bonded, as
discussed below.
This class includes
(a) Alkyl halides or haloalkanes (R—X)
In alkyl halides, the halogen atom is bonded to an alkyl group (R).
They form a homologous series represented by CnH2n+1X. They are
further classified as primary, secondary or tertiary according to the
nature of carbon to which halogen is attached. If halogen is attached to
a primary carbon atom in an alkyl halide, the alkyl halide is called
primary alkyl halide or 1° alkyl halide. Similarly, if halogen is attached
to secondary or tertiary carbon atom, the alkyl halide is called
secondary alkyl halide (2°) and tertiary (3°) alkyl halide, respectively.
(b) Allylic halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an
sp3-hybridised carbon atom adjacent to carbon-carbon double bond
(C=C) i.e. to an allylic carbon.
(c) Benzylic halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to an
sp3-hybridised carbon atom attached to an aromatic ring.

This class includes:
(a) Vinylic halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is bonded to
a sp2-hybridised carbon atom of a carbon-carbon double bond
(C = C).
(b) Aryl halides
These are the compounds in which the halogen atom is directly
bonded to the sp2-hybridised carbon atom of an aromatic ring.
Having learnt the classification of halogenated compounds, let us now learn
how these are named. The common names of alkyl halides are derived by
naming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system
of nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons.
For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC
names are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the  prefixes o-, m-, p- are
used in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class
XI, the numerals 1,2; 1,3 and 1,4 are used.

Halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, therefore,
carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears
a partial positive charge whereas the halogen atom bears a partial
negative charge.
  As we go down the group in the periodic table, the size of halogen
atom increases. Fluorine atom is the smallest and iodine atom is the
largest. Consequently the carbon-halogen bond length also increases
from C—F to C—I. Some typical bond lengths, bond enthalpies and

      The preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing
dry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating
a mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid.
   The above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl
halides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double
bond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single
bond.

The hydroxyl group of an alcohol is replaced by halogen on reaction with
concentrated halogen acids, phosphorus halides or thionyl chloride.
Thionyl chloride is preferred because in this reaction alkyl halide is formed
along with gases SO2 and HCl. The two gaseous products are escapable,
hence, the reaction gives pure alkyl halides. The reactions of primary and
secondary alcohols with HCl require the presence of a catalyst, ZnCl2.
With tertiary alcohols, the reaction is conducted by simply shaking the
alcohol with concentrated HCl at room temperature. Constant boiling
with HBr (48%) is used for preparing alkyl bromide. Good yields of
R—I may be obtained by heating alcohols with sodium or potassium
iodide in 95% orthophosphoric acid. The order of reactivity of alcohols
with a given haloacid is 3°>2°>1°. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide
are usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the
reaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively.

(ii) Addition of halogens: In the laboratory, addition of bromine in
CCl4 to an alkene resulting in discharge of reddish brown colour
of bromine constitutes an important method for the detection of
double bond in a molecule. The addition results in the synthesis
of vic-dibromides, which are colourless (Unit 9, Class XI).
Alkyl iodides are often prepared by the reaction of alkyl chlorides/

reaction.

Aryl chlorides and bromides can be easily prepared by electrophilic
substitution of arenes with chlorine and bromine respectively in the
presence of Lewis acid catalysts like iron or iron(III) chloride.
The ortho and para isomers can be easily separated due to large
difference in their melting points. Reactions with iodine are reversible
in nature and require the presence of an oxidising agent (HNO3,
HIO4) to oxidise the HI formed during iodination. Fluoro compounds
are not prepared by this method due to high reactivity of fluorine.
(ii) From amines by Sandmeyer’s reaction
When a primary aromatic amine, dissolved or suspended in cold
aqueous mineral acid, is treated with sodium nitrite, a diazonium
salt is formed. Mixing the solution of freshly prepared diazonium
salt with cuprous chloride or cuprous bromide results in the
replacement of the diazonium group by –Cl or –Br.
Replacement of the diazonium group by iodine does not require the
presence of cuprous halide and is done simply by shaking the diazonium
salt with potassium iodide.

Melting and boiling points
Methyl chloride, methyl bromide, ethyl chloride and some
chlorofluoromethanes are gases at room temperature. Higher members
are liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic
halogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well
as higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the
intermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals)
are stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points
of chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those
of the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass.
The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and
have more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different
halides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling
points of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This
is because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the
magnitude of van der Waal forces increases.
The boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase
in branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest
boiling point among the three isomers.
Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same.
However, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their ortho-
and meta-isomers. It is due to symmetry of para-isomers that fits in
crystal lattice better as compared to ortho- and meta-isomers.

169 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes
Solubility
The haloalkanes are very slightly soluble in water. In order to dissolve
haloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between
the haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water
molecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between
the haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the
original hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes
in water is low. However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents
because the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and
solvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken
in the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules.
Table 6.3: Density of Some Haloalkanes
Density
Bromo, iodo and polychloro derivatives of hydrocarbons are heavier than
water. The density increases with increase in  number of carbon atoms,
halogen atoms and atomic mass of the halogen atoms (Table 6.3).
The reactions of haloalkanes may be divided into the following categories:
1. Nucleophilic substitution
2. Elimination reactions
3. Reaction with metals.

already existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic
substitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions.
In this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the
substrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded
to halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,
called leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution
reaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic
substitution reaction.
It is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl
halides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon. The
products formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with some common
nucleophiles are given in Table 6.4.
Groups like cyanides and nitrites possess two nucleophilic centres
and are called ambident nucleophiles. Actually cyanide group is a
hybrid of two contributing structures and therefore can act as a
nucleophile in two different ways [VCºN « :C=NV], i.e., linking through

leading to isocyanides. Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident
nucleophile with two different points of linkage [–O— N
i i
=O]. The linkage
through oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it
leads to nitroalkanes.
Mechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different
mechanims which are described below:
(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (SN2)
The reaction between CH3Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and
chloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends
upon the concentration of both the reactants.
Haloalkanes react with KCN to form alkyl cyanides as main product
while AgCN forms isocyanides as the chief product. Explain.
KCN is predominantly ionic and provides cyanide ions in solution.
Although both carbon and nitrogen atoms are in a position to donate
electron pairs, the attack takes place mainly through carbon atom and
not through nitrogen atom since C—C bond is more stable than C—N
bond. However, AgCN is mainly covalent in nature and nitrogen is free
to donate electron pair forming isocyanide as the main product.

The above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in
Fig. 6.2.
It depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction;
the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the
carbon-halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between
carbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C-O bond formed between
C and -OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a
Fig. 6.2:
Red ball represents the incoming hydroxide ion and green ball represents
the outgoing halide ion
In the year 1937,
Edward Davies Hughes
and Sir Christopher
Ingold 
proposed 
a
mechanism for an SN2
reaction.
The solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the
paper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper.

Chemistry
single step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses
and the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon
atom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving
group weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds
of the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In
transition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the
attacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the
carbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon,
C-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking
nucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon.
As a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of
carbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an
umbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This
process is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition
state, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming
nucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are
unstable and cannot be isolated. Thus, in the transition state, carbon
is simultaneously bonded to five atoms.
Hughes worked under
Ingold and earned a
D.Sc. degree from the
University of London.
Since this reaction requires the approach of the nucleophile to the
carbon bearing the leaving group, the presence of bulky substituents
on or near the carbon atom have a dramatic inhibiting effect. Of the
simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in SN2 reactions
because there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides
are the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching
Configuration
Spacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration.
See the structures (A) and (B) given below carefully.
These are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial  arrangement
of functional groups attached to carbon. Structure (A) is mirror image of Structure (B).
We say configuration of carbon in structure (A) is mirror image of the configuration of
carbon in structure (B).

nucleophiles. Thus the order of reactivity followed is:
Primary halide > Secondary halide > Tertiary halide.
(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular (SN1)
SN1 reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents
(like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tert-
butyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert-butyl alcohol and
follows the first order kinetics, i.e., the rate of reaction depends
upon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert- butyl
bromide.
It occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C—Br bond undergoes
slow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The
carbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II
to complete the substitution reaction.

Rationalised 2023-24

174
Chemistry
Step I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C–Br bond breaking for which the
energy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since
the rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the
concentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater
the stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster
will be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 3
0 alkyl halides undergo SN1 reaction
very fast because of the high stability of 3
0 carbocations. We  can sum up the order of reactivity
of alkyl halides towards SN1 and SN2 reactions as follows:
For the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the SN1
reaction. The carbocation thus formed gets stabilised through resonance (Unit 8, Class XI) as
shown below:
In the following pairs of halogen compounds, which would undergo

(c) Stereochemical aspects of nucleophilic substitution reactions
In order to understand the stereochemical aspects of substitution
reactions, we need to learn some basic stereochemical principles
and notations (optical activity, chirality, retention, inversion,
racemisation, etc.).
(i) Optical activity: Plane of plane polarised light produced by
passing ordinary light through Nicol prism is rotated when it
is passed through the solutions of  certain compounds. Such
compounds are called optically active compounds. The angle
by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an
instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane
of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it
is called dextrorotatory (Greek for right rotating) or the d-form
and is indicated by placing a positive (+) sign before the degree
of rotation. If the light is rotated towards left (anticlockwise
direction), the compound is said to be laevo-rotatory or the
l-form and a negative (–) sign is placed before the degree of
rotation. Such (+) and (–) isomers of a compound are called
optical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical
isomerism.
(ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The
observation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain
compounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the
foundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that
aqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical
rotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration)
but opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in
optical activity was associated with the three dimensional
arrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of
(i) CH3CH2CH2CH2Br < (CH3)2CHCH2Br < CH3CH2CH(Br)CH3 < (CH3)3CBr  (SN1)
CH3CH2CH2CH2Br > (CH3)2CHCH2Br > CH3CH2CH(Br)CH3> (CH3)3CBr (SN2)
Of the two primary bromides, the carbocation intermediate derived from
(CH3)2CHCH2Br is more stable than derived from CH3CH2CH2CH2Br because
of greater electron donating inductive effect of (CH3)2CH- group. Therefore,
(CH3)2CHCH2Br is more reactive than CH3CH2CH2CH2Br in SN1 reactions.
CH3CH2CH(Br)CH3 is a secondary bromide and (CH3)3CBr  is a tertiary
bromide. Hence the above order is followed in SN1. The reactivity in SN2
reactions follows the reverse order as the steric hinderance around the
electrophilic carbon increases in that order.
(ii) C6H5C(CH3)(C6H5)Br > C6H5CH(C6H5)Br >  C6H5CH(CH3)Br > C6H5CH2Br (SN1)
C6H5C(CH3)(C6H5)Br < C6H5CH(C6H5)Br <  C6H5CH(CH3)Br < C6H5CH2Br (SN2)
Of the two secondary bromides, the carbocation intermediate obtained
from C6H5CH(C6H5)Br is more stable than obtained from C6H5CH(CH3)Br
because it is stabilised by two phenyl groups due to resonance. Therefore,
the former bromide is more reactive than the latter in SN1 reactions. A
phenyl group is bulkier than a methyl group. Therefore, C6H5CH(C6H5)Br
is less reactive than C6H5CH(CH3)Br in SN2 reactions.

Chemistry
two types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van’t Hoff and French
scientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently
argued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies)
around a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents
attached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the
molecule is not superimposed (overlapped) on the molecule;
such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre.
The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to
as asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along
with non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for
the optical activity in such organic compounds.
The symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day
objects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to
their mirror images and can be superimposed.
However, many objects are non superimposable on
their mirror images. For example, your left and right
hand look similar but if you put your left hand on
your right hand by moving them in the same plane,
they do not coincide. The objects which are non-
superimposable on their mirror image (like a pair
of hands) are said to be chiral and this property is
known as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically
active, while the objects, which are, superimposable
on their mirror images are called achiral. These
molecules are optically inactive.
The above test of molecular chirality can be
applied to organic molecules by constructing
models and its mirror images or by drawing three
dimensional structures and attempting to
superimpose them in our minds. There are other
aids, however, that can assist us in recognising
chiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of
As you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric
carbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not
different. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure
C) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures
completely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule.

The stereoisomers related to each other as non-
superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers
(Fig. 6.7). A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are
enantiomers.
Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely,
melting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ
with respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the
enantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory.
A mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions
will have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer
will be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such
a mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic
modification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl
or (±) before the name, for example (±) butan-2-ol. The process
of conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as
racemisation.

(iii) Retention: Retention of configuration is the preservation of the spatial
arrangement of bonds to an asymmetric centre during a chemical
reaction or transformation.
In general, if during a reaction, no bond to the stereocentre is broken,
the product will have the same general configuration of groups
around the stereocentre as that of reactant. Such a reaction is said
to proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an
example, the reaction that takes place when (–)-2-methylbutan-1-ol
is heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid.

It is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in
the reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation
has changed in the product. This is so because two different
compounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have
different optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of
optical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of
optical rotation).
(iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes
for a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly
linked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the
replacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction;
If (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention
of configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A.
If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion
of configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B.
Rationalised 2023-24

179 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes
If a 50:50 mixture of  A and B is obtained then the process is called
racemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will
rotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another.
Now let us have a fresh look at SN1 and SN2 mechanisms by
taking examples of optically active alkyl halides.
In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a
result of SN2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared
to the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the
side opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When
(–)-2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,
(+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the –OH group occupying the position
opposite to what bromide had occupied.
Thus, SN2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by
inversion of configuration.
In case of optically active alkyl halides, SN1 reactions are
accompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it
happens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp
2
hybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be
accomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in
a mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the –OH
attaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having
opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide
ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active
2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of (±)-butan-2-ol.
2. Elimination reactions
When a haloalkane with b-hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic
solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen
atom from b-carbon and a halogen atom from the a-carbon atom.

As a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since b-hydrogen
atom is involved in elimination, it is often called b

b-elimination.
If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to
the availability of more than one b-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene
is formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first
observed by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as
Saytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as
“in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that
alkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the
doubly bonded carbon atoms.” Thus, 2-bromopentane gives
pent-2-ene as the major product.
3. Reaction with metals
Most organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain
metals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such
compounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An
important class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor
Grignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgX, referred as
Grignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of
haloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether.
A chemical reaction is the result of competition; it is a race that is won by the fastest
runner. A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An
alkyl halide with b-hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two
competing routes: substitution (SN1 and SN2) and elimination. Which route will be taken
up depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and
reaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts
a proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa.
Similarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a SN2 reaction, a secondary halide- SN2 or
elimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- SN1 or
elimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene.

181 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes
Victor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he
took a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was
not to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic
chemistry. While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process
of methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this
purpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be
successful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard
used this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained
a professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded
the Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who
had made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation.
 In the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent
but highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive
magnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic.
Grignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of
proton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently
acidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons.
It is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard
reagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other
hand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting
halides to hydrocarbons.
Wurtz reaction
Alkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give  hydrocarbons
containing double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide.
This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction.
1. Nucleophilic substitution
Aryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic
substitution reactions due to the following reasons:
(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen
atom are in conjugation with p-electrons of the ring and the
following resonating structures are possible.
C—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to
resonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult
than haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards
nucleophilic substitution reaction.

Haloarenes
Rationalised 2023-24

182
Chemistry
(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C—X bond: In
haloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp3
hybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached
to halogen is sp2-hybridised.
The sp2 hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more
electronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond
more tightly than sp3-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with
less s-chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is
177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to
break a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes
are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic
substitution reaction.
(iii) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl
cation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised
by resonance and therefore, SN1 mechanism is ruled out.
(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron
rich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.
Replacement by hydroxyl group
Chlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous
sodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure
of 300 atmospheres.
The presence of an electron withdrawing group (-NO2) at ortho- and
para-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes.

183 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes
The effect is pronounced when (-NO2) group is introduced at ortho-
and para- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is
observed by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta-position.
Mechanism of the reaction is as depicted:
Can you think why does NO2 group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions
and not at meta- position?
As shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the
electron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile
on haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative
charge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is
stabilised by –NO2 group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating
structures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the –NO2 group. Therefore,
the presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and
no effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of –NO2 group at meta-position.

2. Electrophilic substitution reactions
Haloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene
ring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts
reactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is o, p-
directing; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and para-
positions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p-directing influence
of halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating
structures of halobenzene as shown:
Due to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and
para-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom
because of its –I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from
the benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as
compared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions
in haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as
compared to those in benzene.

(iv) Friedel-Crafts reaction
Although chlorine is an electron withdrawing group, yet it is ortho-,
para- directing in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Why?
Chlorine withdraws electrons through inductive effect and releases
electrons through resonance. Through inductive effect, chlorine
destabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic
substitution.
Through resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and
the effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The
inductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron
withdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect
tends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and para-
positions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and para-
attack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect
and orientation is controlled by resonance effect.

Carbon compounds containing more than one halogen atom are usually
referred to as polyhalogen compounds. Many of these compounds are
useful in industry and agriculture. Some polyhalogen compounds are
described in this section.
Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a
propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of
drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene
chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower
levels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing
and vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness,
nausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct
skin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild
redness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea.
Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,
iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in
the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a
general anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,
safer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as
an anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central
nervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million
parts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness,
fatigue, and headache. Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage
to the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the
kidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in
chloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of
light to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as
phosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles
completely filled so that air is kept out.
It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are
due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due
to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations
containing iodine.
It is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of
refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as
feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals,
pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid
1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry,
as a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire
extinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon
tetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects
are dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause
permanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead
rapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl4
can make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate
the eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air,
it rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the

The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively
known as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, non-
corrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 (CCl2F2) is one of the
most common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from
tetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced
for aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By
1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds
annually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes
its way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the
stratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain
reactions that can upset the natural ozone balance.
DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared
in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy
Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as
an insecticide. Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine
and Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased
enormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because
of its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice
that carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT
began to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed
resistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity
towards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility
compounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by
animals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If
ingestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal
over time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973,
although it is still in use in some other parts of the world.

halogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive

phosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by
electrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen
exchange method.
The boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the
corresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces
of attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic
solvents.
The polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their
nucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form
organometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into
SN1 and SN2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in
understanding the reaction mechanisms of SN1 and SN2 reactions. SN2 reactions of
chiral alkyl halides are characterised by the inversion of configuration while SN1 reactions
are characterised by racemisation.
A number of polyhalogen compounds e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform, iodoform,
carbon tetrachloride, freon and DDT have many industrial applications. However,
some of these compounds cannot be easily decomposed and even cause depletion of
ozone layer and are proving environmental hazards.

(i) CH3CH2CH2CH2Br
Being primary halide, there won’t be any
steric hindrance.
(ii)
Secondary halide reacts faster than tertiary
halide.
(iii)
The presence of methyl group closer to the
halide group will increase the steric
hindrance and decrease the rate.
The equivalent hydrogens are grouped as a, b and
c. The replacement of equivalent hydrogens will
give the same product.
All the hydrogen atoms are equivalent and replacement
of any hydrogen will give the same product.
Similarly the equivalent hydrogens are grouped as
a, b, c and d. Thus, four isomeric products are
possible.
6.8
(i)
Tertiary halide reacts faster than secondary halide
because of the greater stability of tert-carbocation.
(ii)
Because of greater stability of secondary carbocation than
primary.
